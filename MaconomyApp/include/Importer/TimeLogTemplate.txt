# # Weekday entries
#
# Defines the day of the week. Time line entries following this entry
# will be put under that weekday in Maconomy.
#
# Valid values are: mandag, tisdag, onsdag, torsdag, fredag
#
# Example:
#
# mandag
#
# # # # # # # # #

# # Time line entry
#
# Defines an entry in the time log.
# Each argument should be tab-separated.
# Structure is:
#
# <Daily description>	<Job name>	<Task name>   <Time intervals>  [Spec3] [Processed]
#
# Arguments enclosed with '[]' are optional.
#
# <Daily description> : This is the daily description which will show up in Maconomy.
#
# <Job name> : This should be the local job name as defined by the config file.
#			   Can be specified as either one job or two jobs (split) with space-separation.
#			   Example:
#					Simple job:	SE
#					Split job : SE NO
#
#
# <Task name> : This is the local task name as defined by the config.
#
# <Time interval> : These are time intervals specifying the time worked on each task.
#					Multiple intervals can be specified on the same row.
#					They should be tab-separated.
#					Example: 10:00 - 13:00	14:00 - 16:00
#
# [Spec3] : Optional, specifies the Spec3 for the given row. If none is provided
#			the default one specified in the config file is used.
#
# [Processed] : Dictates wheter this row has already been processed by the program or not.
#				Usually this should be omitted, it's the program's responsibility to
#				fill this in after the import.
#				Rows with this specified will NOT be processed by the program.
#				Values should be: X or x
#
#
# Example:
#
# JOB-0001	SE	Jira	08:00 - 09:00	11:30 - 12:00
